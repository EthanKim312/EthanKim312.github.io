  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h2>Bakeology Origins</h2>
  <p>Bakeology started as most things do, as an experiment. While cooking as a
family in the kitchen, we felt like scientists in a lab. We have been
experimenting since 2005 trying to make the perfect concoctions by
adding a pinch of sugar, changing flavors, and altering the recipes for
mouth-watering desserts you will never forget.</p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>We strive to provide homemade quality baked goods. We all imagine the
yummy baked goods from our favorite places, but more importantly, how
we feel when eating them. We hope our creations will provide you some
happiness and peace all while enjoying savory desserts that will have your
taste buds exploding.</p>

   <h2>Hours</h2>
  <p>We are open Monday through Saturday from 7 am to 2 pm. Orders can be
